 %   Hello, there! Attention is all you need to graduate %\cite{Vaswani:2017:NeurIPS}.


At the end of our computer science degree program, we were tasked with completing a final year project, and we decided to develop a mobile application for blood donation. Our project aimed to provide a user-friendly platform for individuals to donate blood and connect with blood donation centers. The development of the blood donation app allowed us to learn about a new development platform and expand our knowledge and experience.

Our final year project consisted of three major chapters. In the first chapter, we conducted entrance to mobile applications in the medical field, followed by a conceptual study of our "Drop Angel" application in the second chapter. The third chapter focused on our work environment, including the installation of various development tools, as well as screenshots of the different interfaces in our application.
