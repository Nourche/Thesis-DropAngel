First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor for his continuous support, patience, motivation. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. 

I am very thankful to many friends for their support, encouragement, helps,listening during this thesis as well as before it.

Last but not the least, I would like to mention the contribution of my family as the main source of strength in my life. I am grateful the unconditional support and affection of my parents.

This thesis would not have been possible without these people.
