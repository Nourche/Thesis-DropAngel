In conclusion, our blood donation app project aimed to provide a user-friendly platform for blood donors and donation centers. The development of the "Drop Angel" app allowed us to expand our knowledge and experience in mobile app development while also contributing to a noble cause. Throughout the project, we faced challenges and limitations, such as the need for better documentation and more time for testing and implementing additional features.

However, we were able to successfully complete the project and believe that the app has the potential to make a positive impact on blood donation efforts. We hope that our project serves as a starting point for further development and innovation in the field of blood donation apps.


During our research, we found that there was a need for a blood donation app with a simple and intuitive design, which could be easily used by donors and blood donation centers alike. Our "Drop Angel" app aims to meet this need and facilitate the donation process.

Looking to the future, we plan to further enhance our app's functionality by adding features such as a rewards system to incentivize donors, as well as integrating with other healthcare apps for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare.
