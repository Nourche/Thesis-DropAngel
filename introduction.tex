The desire to benefit others at a cost to the self is the most commonly frequently mentioned reason for donating blood which is the most precious thing that anyone can give to any one in need ,and that can save millions of lives. Even though people do not donate blood regularly, there is a constant effort to balance the supply and demand of blood. 
As in Algeria, almost all Willayas facing the difficulty to beg for blood donors, recognized
by the Algerian donation centers. The problem is getting worse especially during the
festive and holiday seasons. Since there is a serious blood shortage in the blood bank, accident victims
who are in need of blood are not be able to be saved. A minimal participation from Algerian
citizens is recorded, even though blood donation activities are organized everywhere. This issue has created
the need to understand the population and associate factors that can increase their motivation
and willingness to be a blood donor,and that the aim of "Drop Angel" which is a mobile application 
 designed to connect blood donors with blood banks and hospitals in need of blood products , enhance the efficiency of the blood donation process and
to create awareness and encourage others to be a blood donors
